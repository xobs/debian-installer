  * Add myself to uploaders.
  * Acknowledge bugs closed in previous version which was uploaded as NMU by
    mistake. Closes: #343674, #344854.
  * Add missing build dependency on apt-utils (needed for localudebs handling).

  * Stop using mklibs-copy on ia64, now that #326103 is fixed.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Deal with dpkg-deb output change in udeb version extraction code.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Switch to 2.6.14 kernel for i386 and sparc64.
  * Run with udev by default (2.6 kernels only). This is now required for i386
    and should also work with 2.6.12 kernels for other arches.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add slightly more error checking to genbuilddeps.
  * Include rescue-mode in monolithic images.
  * Use pcmciautils-udeb instead of pcmcia-cs-udeb on architectures that
    have moved to kernels newer than 2.6.12.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Make socket-modules kernel udeb optional in pkg-lists, it's going away in
    current 2.6 kernels.

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * Switch to 2.6.14 kernel for amd64.

  [ dann frazier ]
  * Switch to 2.6.14 kernel for ia64.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * No longer use discover and usb-discover for 2.6 based installations (all
    architectures).
  * Include pciutils-udeb for 2.6 based installations (all architectures).
    This brings back display of NIC names when a system has more than one and
    allows save-logs to include lspci info.
  * Update to libdevmapper1.02 in monolithic target.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Add needed-characters for Khmer (1780-17FF range)
  * Add needed-characters for Nepali

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Removed nic-extra-modules, isa-pnp-modules, usb-modules from the netwinder
    netboot image since none should be useful on a netwinder and the netwinder
    has a hard 4 mb limit to the initrd size. Closes: #343674
  * Switch all i386 2.6 images to initramfs.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Updated powerpc config to 2.6.14-2 kernels.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Patch from Rod Whitby to support jffs2 generation. Closes: #344854
  * Document the new MKFS_JFFS2 variable.
  * Allow for TEMP_INITRD (and presumably INITRD too) to be theoretically
    changed to something that makes more sense for jffs2 images.

  [ Martin Michlmayr ]
  * Add initial support for BCM947xx mipsel devices but don't activate it.
  * Add 2.6 images for Footbridge (CATS and Netwinder).
  * Add support for NSLU2 devices on arm and armeb.
  * Support SSH installations on Cobalt.
  * Remove code to build xxs1500 images since this was never supported.
  * Reorganize the DECstation tree and put images in sub-dirs.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Switch i386 to the 2.6.15-1 kernel.

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * Switch amd64 to the 2.6.15-1 kernel.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Switch sparc to the 2.6.15-1 kernel.
  * Change build dependency from sysutils to tofrodos as package was split.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Switch powerpc to the 2.6.15-1 kernel.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Switch alpha to the 2.6.15-1 kernel.
  * Add scsi-common-modules to the alpha cdrom initrd.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Don't drop English translations for S/390 initrds.
  * Also remove Indices-* and Default-* lines when dropping translations.
  * Include sparc-utils-udeb for sbus detection on Sparc 2.6 based installs.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Update hppa to 2.6.15-1 kernel. Completly and utterly untested.

  [ Stephen R. Marenka ]
  * Update m68k to 2.6.15-1 kernel.
  * Add console-keymaps-at to m68k.cfg's to appease kbd-chooser
    (keeps us from getting the console-keymaps-acorn).

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add missing floppy-modules udeb to powerpc root floppy.

  [ Stephen R. Marenka ]
  * Added amiboot dependency for m68k.

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * Stop building the monolithic target on amd64.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Only generate /etc/lsb-release if a udeb hasn't already provided it.
  * Move "main/debian-installer" (for sources.list.udeb) to a
    UDEB_COMPONENTS variable in build/config/common, so that people can more
    easily build with e.g. non-free udebs.
  * Include module-init-tools-udeb when using udev; busybox modprobe doesn't
    seem to support enough of newer kernel features like aliases and
    blacklisting to be usable there yet.
  * Use [2.6] for udev pkg-lists instead of kernel_specific.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Switch to root=/dev/ram in syslinux configs to support 2.6.14 post-devfs
    kernels.
  * Did away with the kernel_specific pkg-lists directories.
  * Back to managing localudebs with apt. To support secure apt,
    authentication is disabled and a warning printed if there are any udebs
    in the localudebs directory. During an official build there will not be
    any and the downloaded udebs will be properly authenticated.
  * pkg-list: Turn off debugging as the dep resolutuon stuff is working ok
    now.

  * Add cramfsprogs dependency for mipsel. Closes: #334780
  * Syslinux ignores failures due to being out of disk space (#335152).
    Avoid this bug by running syslinux on the original, empty disk
    image.
  * If the boot logo can't be copied onto a floppy, don't fail, just proceed
    on without a boot logo. Yes, we're that short on space on the i386 boot
    floppies, no more logos for them until space is freed up.
  * Deal with changed case of Kernel-Version fields in stat generation code.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Improve wording of debian-installer binary package description.

  * Workaround #326103 by using mklibs-copy instead of mklibs on ia64.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Drop hotplug-udeb from udev package list; udev-udeb is sufficient now
    that coldplugging support has been added to it.
  * Build mini.iso images for powerpc and powerpc64 netboot.

  * Use cramfs images on mipsel. Current mipsel binaries compress very well.
    Needs newest mipsel kernel udebs.
  * Drop EXTRALIBS. Use EXTRAFILES, code was the same, and it's not used
    otherwise.
  * Copy in EXTRAFILES before depmod so modules can be included if necessary.
  * Remove libiw udeb from netboot-minimal/powerpc.cfg, will be pulled in by
    mklibs/deps as needed.
  * During library reduction, copy in libraries from driver disks same as
    other libraries so mklibs knows where to find them. This is a hack to
    let mklibs work if building a root floppy with driver disks that include
    libraries that are not on the root floppy. It's not ideal, since the
    library gets added to the root floppy by mklibs now. (This issue currently
    only occurs because netcfg, on the root floppies, is linked statically
    and wireless-tools, on some the driver disks, is not.)
  * Back to building from udebs in etch (yeah, it really works now).
  * Further workaround for #329733.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Add the list of needed characters for Sanskrit

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Split manual out into its own top-level directy, and removed it from build
    deps and build system. The debian-installer-manual tracking package is
    replaced by a (currently mostly empty) debian-installer tracking package.

  [ Frans Pop ]

    build-dependency, since it apparently confuses sbuild on architectures
    without libc6-pic.

  [ Bdale Garbee ]
  * updates for hppa support of 2.6.12 kernels

  [ Sylvain Ferriol ]
  * When ONLINE=n, APT must not cleanup lists directory.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add preseed-common to all initrds, split out from file/network-preseed.
  * Add initrd-preseed too.
  * Add a PRESEED variable, which can be used to specify a preseed file to
    add to the initrd in the location initrd-preseed expects to find one
    (/preseed.cfg).
  * Default PRESEED to unstable.cfg, which sets mirror/udeb/suite, which
    means that all d-i developmental and daily builds that download udebs
    will download them from unstable, not testing.
  * However, in release builds of the package, this is unset, so those will
    pull udebs from testing as previously.
  * Try adding root=/dev/fd0 to the silo.floppy.conf since at least the 2.4
    kernel floppies are reported to not boot without it. This change may
    also affect the 2.6 kernel floppies, which need to be tested.
    Closes: #301374
  * Make syslinux configs use "install" as the label to install, in
    preparation for rescue mode. "linux" continues to work for
    compatability.
  * Add "install24" and "expert24" labels to syslinux configs, in
    preparation for making i386 use 2.6 by default.
  * Turn on dependency resolution for nic-extra-modules, especially useful
    since it has a new dependency in 2.6.11.
  * Turn on dependency resolution for standard-udebs and
    kernel-module-udebs. This allos most of the mess in monolithic/common
    to be removed as the dependencies pull most of it in, except where
    they're still broken.
  * When preseeding mirror/suite, don't make it be seen, so user can
    override from the default.
  * Recent additions (initrd-preseed) made the el-torito image too big on
    i386, drop usb CD support from it to make it build again.
    Stop abusing the build system in sparc.cfg by pretending that cdrom
    and miniiso are subarches. Add a "combined" subarch for these images
    that really contain both sparc64 and sparc32 support.
  * Included 2.6.8 kernel for amd64. Closes: #307306
  * Add support for creating initramfs initrd images (needs rootskel 1.12).
  * Move /unifont.bgf into lib. Needs rootskel 1.12.
  * Resisted the urge to drop i386 el-torito images, which filled up again
    once 2.6 fb-modules was fixed, and instead just dropped all translations
    from these (unused) images.
  * Add rescue-check to all images.
  * Add rescue, rescue24, and rescue26 boot options in syslinux.
  * To document these in syslinux, removed the old, useless f9.txt, and
    shifted f4 through f8 up one; the new f4 documents rescue mode.
  * Updated one place in the manual that referred to fn documents to reflect
    above change.
  * Document rescue mode in ia64 boot screens, but don't add stanzas for it
    since that would go over the limit of 16. Users will have to type
    rescue/enable=true
  * Add stanzas for rescue mode and document in sparc boot screen.
  * Remove devfs=mount from syslinux.cfg. Needs rootskel-bootfloppy 1.13.
  * Use dependency resolution for floppy-retriever, since mountfloppy has
    been split off of it and into a dependency.
  * Add bugreporter-udeb to the i386 root floppy, to cdrom images, and even
    to netboot images, so users can use it to report bugs earlier. Add
    commented out versions to other images on which it won't be very useful,
    since it currently required floppy support.
  * Update the manual for the /var/log/debian-installer ->
    /var/log/installer move.
  * Update the manual for the bugreporter-udeb rename, and for its
    new capailities.
  * Add an /etc/lsb-release file to the initrd, which includes the image
    build date. Useful for determining the provenance of an image.
    Closes: #250321
  * bugreporter-udeb got renamed and is now on more images.
  * Remove redundant rootskel entry from access floppy's package list.
  * Add mountfloppy to each initrd that contains save-logs, except for the
    s390 generic one. save-logs can now drop its dependency on mountfloppy.
  * Make the image tarball be listed as raw-installer in the changes file.
  * Switch to localechooser.
  * Drop all translations from the m68k floppy, which filled up when
    localechooser was added to it, since it didn't have countrychooser on it
    before.
  * Add new env-preseed to base pkg-list.
  * Turn of dpkg logging during image building. Need to depend on new dpkg
    for this.
  * Add support for virtual packages to pkg-lists.
  * Set DEBIAN_VERSION to etch.
  * Switch from hw-detect-full to disk-detect.
  * Updates for libiw28. Remove libiw27 from build deps and from exclude
    list, since the udeb is in fact used now to provide the library and
    netcfg's dependencies have been fixes. Enable dependency resolution
    for netcfg. Now no more updates should be needed here when libiw
    changes.
  * Temporarily disable nano from all images, as it's linked to slang2 and
    the rest of d-i is not, and library reduction cannot cope with two
    slangs.
  * Change udeb list format to match file format expected by katie (add
    arch field).
  * Make update-manifest also manage a MANIFEST.udeb file listing the udebs
    inside each file in the manifest, and pass prameters to update-manifest
    calls to provide this information.
  * Include a udeb.list, based on the MANIFEST.udeb, but munged so katie can
    read it natively, inside the images tarball. This will be used to
    ensure that sources for d-i images do not fall out of the archive.
  * Copyright file updates for 2005.
  * Fix manual to note that linux supports HFS+. Closes: #313488
  * Unset LANG in chroot call in chroot-install section of manual.
    Closes: #311704
  * ia64 does not support rarp, remove from manual. Closes: #250028
  * Document deconf-set-selections -c to check preseed files. Closes: #284289
  * Try to pass appropriate manual_release when building the manual in rules
    file.
  * Switch to slang2.
  * Switch from busybox-cvs to busybox.
  * New busybox supports 2.6 modules, so the hack with modutils-udeb is not
    needed anymore.
  * Add isolinux.cfg files to the debian-cd-into tarball, so that we
    don't have to maintain the same stuff in debian-cd.
  * Switch i386 images that contain a 2.6 kernel to boot 2.6 by default,
    install24 etc boot 2.4.
  * Allow apt to run unauthenticated in offline mode since it may not have
    cached a Release.gpg.
  * di-utils-bootfloppy removed, pipe_progress moved to busybox.

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * Changed libdevmapper1.00-udeb to libdevmapper1.01-udeb in the monolithic
    package list. Closes: #306976
  * Change amd64 kernel from 2.6.8-10 to 2.6.8-11.
  * Do not install nano in the monolithic target.
  * Change amd64 kernel from 2.6.8-11 to 2.6.12-1.

  [ Christian Perrier ]

  * Add the list of needed characters for Kurdish
  * Add the list of needed characters for Georgian
  * Add the list of needed characters for Icelandic
  * Add the list of needed characters for Hebrew
  * Add the list of needed characters for Kannada
  * Add the list of needed characters for Tamil
  * Complete the list of needed characters for Persian with the help of
    Arash Bizanjadeh and Eugenyi Meshcheryakov
  * build/Makefile: include xx_YY files from needed-characters to all.utf
    and not only xx files

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Force HOME=$(TEMP) for hfsutils calls throughout powerpc
    hd_media_common target.
  * Ship yaboot with powerpc hd-media images.
  * Add rescue stanzas to yaboot configuration files.
  * Document raised kernel command-line limits in 2.6.9.
  * Remove devfs=mount from yaboot configuration files. It shouldn't be
    needed any more.
  * Don't remove modules.*map from the initrd if we're using real hotplug.
  * Use the kernel-specific discover and isa-pnp-modules include files
    rather than explicitly listing those udebs throughout pkg-lists.
  * Make a note about another possible cause for 'locale charmap' being
    wrong during font generation, since it confused me for days ...
  * Document new-style timezone preseeding, available from base-config
    2.65.
  * Document rescue mode in the manual.
  * Remove historic manual files from (variously) woody and the old build
    system.
  * Copy KEYRING into the initrd, as /usr/share/keyrings/archive.gpg. I'm
    relying on the keyring being small here, although we should really have
    a keyring udeb instead.
  * Build-depend on gnupg; apt requires it to verify signatures.
  * Add udev pkg-lists files (including both udev and hotplug); not used by
    default yet.
  * Add real alternatives for virtual glibc-pic build-dependency.
  * Remove powerpc-builtin-initrd.sh and corresponding bzip2
    build-dependency on powerpc; we use mkvmlinuz everywhere now.
  * Keep modules.alias in udev/hotplug builds; new coldplug udev needs it.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Fix logic error in build/util/pkg-list to get rid of incorrect warnings
    about missing lists.
  * Add build dependencies needed to build PDF/TXT versions of the manual.
  * Make main build script for the manual fail on errors.
  * Introduce cascading stylesheet for the HTML version of the manual.
  * Modify build depends to allow openjade1.3 as well as openjade.
  * Add appendix on installing over plip, contributed by Sylvain Ferriol;
    edited by Frans Pop.
  * Document network-console in manual.
  * Switch sparc to 2.6.12 kernel, dropping 2.6 support for sparc32 as there
    is no 2.6.12. kernel available.
  * Update silo configurations to properly support install, expert and rescue.
  * Enable building both 2.4 and 2.6 images for sparc CDs.
  * Split preseeding example in manual into seperate files for Sarge and Etch;
    the differences were getting too great for a single file.

  [ Martin Michlmayr ]
  * Add support for rescue mode to mipsel/cobalt.
  * Rename the default target of {mips,mipsel}/sb1-swarm-bn from
    'installer' to 'install' in compliance with other arches.
  * Add support for rescue mode to {mips,mipsel}/sb1-swarm-bn.

  [ Stephen R. Marenka ]
  * m68k tools rework.
  * incorporate boot/m68k/amiga scripts in tools.
  * initial support for future penguin and amiboot packages.
  * drop 2.2 kernel support for everything but macs.

  [ Eddy Petrisor ]
  * Removed ASCII characters from needed-characters/vi

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add attribution to Karsten M. Self for chroot-install section of the
    manual. Closes: #316487

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Switch i386 to 2.6.11 kernel.
  * Add file-preseed to netboot image so file-based preseeding can be used on
    netboot mini iso.
  * Remove file-preseed from netboot; that won't work since netboot never
    mounts a CD, duh.
  * Enable text frontend for netboot on all arches.
  * Aribitrarily increased sparc ramdisk_size to 9000 from 8192, since
    it's at least 8230 big now due to added languages.
  * Build-depend on newest libdebian-installer as some udebs have a versioned
    dependency on it.
  * Switch i386 to 2.6.12 kernel.
  * Add support for running upx on binaries inside the initrd, and turn it
    on for a marginal space gain in the (full) i386 boot floppy.
  * Remove usb floppy support from speakup boot floppy since it's terminally
    low on space.
  * Add comments to control file about build deps and add genbuilddeps which
    generates the build dep line based on the comments.
  * As part of the review, removed ncurses-base (not used since we got the
    terminfo udeb), and libnewt0.51 (pulled in by a dep from libnewt-dev)
    and cpio (WTF?)

  [ dann frazier ]
  * Switch ia64 to 2.6.12 kernel.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Turned on dependency resolution by default for udebs in pkg-lists.
  * Add libnss-files-udeb to exclude list to work around bug #322506
    (removed again as #322506 was fixed and the exclusion broke
     network-console for S/390 - FJP).
  * Optimise pkg-lists a bit.
  * rootskel-locale renamed to installation-locale.
  * Move md5sums and udeb.list generation into "release" target of
    build/Makefile and run these as part of the daily build too.
  * Cleaned up various userdevfs cruft, goes along with a reworked
    userdevfs udeb.
  * As part of userdevfs cleanup, removed m68k initrd22 images,
    the regular initrds should work wih 2.2 kernels.
  * Add ads subarch for arm, with a "cf" image flavour used to boot
    various ADS arm boards from compact flash. There is not yet a kernel for
    these boards in Debian, so the images do not include a kernel and must be
    used with a monolithic kernel (from ADS).
  * The stats targets no longer build any images. If the image is not built,
    it just won't display stats for it. This is mainly to work around a bug
    that affected the daily builds, where running stats in a separate fakeroot
    after the build would run build again, and rebuild initrds based on the
    trees in tmp, messing up permissions and devices. It also removes a lot of
    unnucessary work in stats, and allows simpler invocation of stats by
    the daily-build script.
  * Don't regenerate the list of udebs in an image in stats, this was
    redundant info and was slow and ugly to generate there.
  * Remove config/local from svn and add a comment to config/common about
    making the file.
  * Add an evil workaround for bug #329733.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Enabled powerpc64 support.
  * Killed all 2.4 powerpc kernels except apus.
  * Upgraded to 2.6.12 powerpc kernels.

    1.6.24.

  [ Dann Frazier ]
  * Drop the Linux 2.4 support for ia64.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Temporarily disabled powerpc floppy builds since they depend on miboot
    kernel udebs that are not in the archive.
  * Temporarily made it build against udebs in sid when releasing this
    package, since it's taking too long to get udebs into etch for a release.

  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Do an e2fsck for the extra floppy images.
    - Handle sparse files in cramfs images more efficiently.
    - Use cramfs images for mips/r4k-ip22 and mips/r5k-ip22.
    - Add cramfsprogs build-dep for mips.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add acpi-modules to the amd64 cdrom, hd-media, monolithic, and netboot
      initrds, so that rootskel can turn the fan on.
    - Use dependency resolution for ide-modules, nic-modules,
      pcmcia-storage-modules, scsi-common-modules, scsi-modules, and
      usb-storage-modules on powerpc, and remove several modules from
      powerpc-extra-modules that only belong on certain images. This removes
      cdrom-core-modules and fs-common-modules from netboot images, and adds
      parport-modules to apus/cdrom (I think it was missing by mistake).
    - Add support for kernel-specific pkg-lists entries: use lines like
      "package [2.2 2.4]" or "package * [2.6]". Should eventually form a
      simpler replacement for the kernel_specific directory.
    - Include initrd.list on amd64/i386 images.
    - Add hd-media image for powerpc, including a boot.img.gz designed for
      use on USB sticks.
    - Document USB booting on powerpc. This involved splitting out the
      documentation for USB booting on i386 a bit.
    - Since power3 and power4 no longer build images with the 2.4 kernel,
      remove their KERNELVERSION_2.4 variables and kernel-build-2.4*
      build-dependencies.
    - Switch libparted1.6-0 build-dependency to libparted1.6-12.
    - Fix support for multiple words in KERNELVERSION.

    - Fix two cases where the pkg-lists dependency checker printed warnings
      about dependencies that were actually ok.
    - Manual correction re debconf/priority.
    - Don't fail to build if sources.list has a cdrom entry in it
      (don't try to use the cdrom as a udeb source, either).

    - Add text frontend to alpha netboot image for general old-timey keenness.
    - Dropped hppa 2.4 images.
    - Removed various things from the hppa 2.6 netboot initrd to make
      it small enough to work again.

      -2 kernel.
    - Add socket-modules to all hppa initrds, also newly modularised.
  * Bdale Garbee

debian-installer (20041227) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add module-init-tools to build deps for ia64 to fix truncated
      modules.dep files and USB keyboard.
    - Add it for sparc too.
    - Add discover1 to even the 2.4 hppa images. Yes, there are no modules
      there, but this allows the de4x5 blacklist code in hw-detect to notice
      that discover1 wants to load de4x5, and blacklist it, avoiding a
      crash when the installed system boots.
    - Add 2.6 netboot image for hppa. Includes a move of the 2.4 netboot
      image into the netboot/ directory for consistency.
    - Fix SUITE setting so debian/rules can override it. I guess this never
      worked as intended before!
  * Christian Perrier
    - Add 7 missing characters to installer/build/needed-characters/ar
      Thanks to Naidim Shaikli and Arabeyes contributors

    - Back to building using udebs in sid to catch the latest set of
      translation updates and other fixes since pre-rc2.
    - upx-ucl-beta 1.93 is broken. Avoid building with this version.
      The safe version to use, 1.91, is in testing. Closes: #275378
    - Make image builds run as root (as part of the binary-arch step),
      rather than as fakeroot, since fakeroot is broken on mips and mipsel.
    - Add nic-modules to the speakup net-drivers floppy. Closes: #275703

  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Handle arch/subarch specific kernel module udeb inclusion.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add page markers to the syslinux help screens.
    - Update install manual section 3.5 to note that d-i can resize fat,
      and to de-emphasise the fips stuff. Closes: #265029
    - Finish moving installation howto to manual.
    - Remove now-useless index.en.html.
    - 24 mb installs are now possible on i386.
    - Add -- to the end of the syslinux kernel append lines so user-params
      can work.
    - Add preseed udebs to initrds and document preseeding in manual.
      Closes: #265988
    - Bump genext2fs build dep to avoid building images with broken versions.
    - Remove the ugly and no longer needed genext2fs size hack.
    - Remove the last uses of load-installer, replacing them with
      download-installer.
    - i386 updated to 2.6.8 and 2.4.27 kernels.
    - Add acpi-modules to i386 2.6 initrds so the fan can be turned on.
      Closes: #264584.
    - Remove function key descriptions from the bottom of the ia64 help
      screens, as in my experience the function keys only work from the
      menu screen.
    - Make ia64 boot screens somewhat more generic so they can be used for
      netboot or other image types besides CD.
    - Use only one elilo.conf for netboot and CD.
    - Revamp the ia64 netboot, provide a netboot.tar.gz image that contains
      a fully preconfigured netboot setup with boot menus for 2.6 and 2.4.
      Make the dest tree have the same layout.
    - Add -- markers to elilo.cfg boot options.
    - Update i386 and amd64 netboot to follow ia64. Note that the tarballs
      have been renamed.
    - Fix ia64 miniiso support to not hardcode use of specific boot image,
      remove the miniiso type, and generate a netboot miniiso instead.
    - Simplify bootscreen-subst parameters.
    - Based on a patch from Alex Owen, make syslinux help screens explain
      on serial consoles how to press function keys there, and add a pxelinux
      config file for 9600 baud serial consoles, available by changing the
      pxelinux.cfg link.
    - Comment out the "NewWorld MacOS Installation Files" section of the
      install manual as it's out of date and has broken links. Closes: #269526
    - Add support for depenency resolution to pkg-lists. For now it has to be
      turned on on a per-package basis by appending an asterisk to the line,
      since many udebs have messed up dependencies and inter-image
      dependencies are not accounted for.
    - Make pkg-list warn about unsatisfied dependencies.
    - Use dependency resolution for the nic-modules package, as its
      dependencies vary from arch to arch and kernel to kernel. Fixes various
      missing deps on i386 and ia64.
    - Use dependency resolution for scsi-modules to get rid of the
      kernel_specific hack.
    - Drop scsi-modules and usb-storage-modules from ia64 netboot image.
    - Put efi-reader on ia64 cdrom image.
    - Remove ia64-extra-modules hack, not needed thanks to nic-modules and
      scsi-modules dependency resolution.
    - Add dependencies of nic-usb-modules to net-drivers floppy (usb-modules
      was missing).
    - Remove useless (and missing dependencies) usb-storage-modules from
      cd-drivers floppy. This made space to add back full pcmcia support on
      this floppy.
    - Add options to elilo boot menu for serial console installs, as I tire
      of typing them.
    - Split access-drivers floppy into net and cd drivers and updated these
      floppies to 2.4.27.
    - Remove ide and scsi modules from various arches netboot images.
    - Move some files to a doc/devel subdirectory.
    - Moved partman docs over from packages/partman, and build them as part
      of the doc build process. Add build dep on debiandoc-sgml.
    - Also moved in partman-auto recipe documentation.
    - Added example preseed file for automated installs.
    - Rewrote design.txt.
    - Use text frontend for ia64 installs via serial console by default,
      since the default ia64 serial console is 9600 baud.
    - Add English to i386 root floppies. Closes: #269971
    - Set build date to the version date from the changelog when doing
      official builds, so all builds of a given version claim the same date.
    - Add a dummy entry to the status file for that gives the overall version
      of the installer image.
    - Build-Depend on syslinux 2.11-0.1 to get fix for parameter bug.
    - Drop all languages from root floppy. Drop all other localised versions
      of root floppy. Document how to make a custom root floppy containing
      the language(s) you need.
      (PC 101: If you can't satisfy everyone, satisfy no-one.)
    - Move countrychooser back to the root floppy.
    - Add wireless-tools-udeb and nic-usb-modules to the root floppy because
      we have the space, so why not?
    - Update hppa to 2.4.27 kernel. Without testing it, but the 2.4.25 kernel
      udebs are no longer available. We need hppa developers..
    - Patch from Jö Fahlke to consistently refer to DEBCONF_FRONTEND in docs.
      debconf/frontend doesn't work everywhere yet, and it's better to only
      support one option.

  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Improve manifest descriptions of the Broadcom BCM1250 (SWARM)
      evaluation board.
    - Put a SiByl TFTP boot configuration script to sb1-swarm-bn/netboot.
    - Put the SiByl boot loader to sb1-swarm-bn/netboot.
    - Update the Cobalt manifest descriptions to reflect reality
      (the config now uses NFS, not TFTP).
    - Create an nfsroot tar file for Cobalt which can easily be extracted
      (containing all files including proper symlinks).
    - Switch mips and mipsel over to 2.4.27.
    - Put USB and input modules on the sb1-swarm-bn/netboot initrd to allow
      "desktop like" installations with framebuffer and USB keyboards.
    - Make sure that the serial console on Cobalt gets turned on.
    - Update installation menu for mips and mipsel.
    - Cleanup the ARM config files: declare most variables in one place and
      use them in various other configs.  This makes it easier to switch
      kernels and makes the code easier to maintain.
    - Switch ARM over to 2.4.27.
  * Kurt Roeckx
    - Use kernel version 2.6.8-3 on amd64.
    - Remove "2.6" in all amd64 flavours since it's the only we have.

    - Debian CDs haven't used /install/powermac for a long time. Switch the
      d-i minimal CD targets to use plain /install.
    - Add -- to the end of the yaboot kernel append lines so user-params can
      work.
    - Don't clean at the end of the daily build (we already clean at the
      start).
    - Move socket-modules from powerpc root-2 to root, otherwise syslogging
      won't work.
    - Remove serial-modules from root-2. It's only needed for strange PPP
      stuff which is not needed on the floppies.
    - Remove PCMCIA support and wireless tools from root-2. The floppies are
      only needed on OldWorld, which probably either won't have PCMCIA or
      will have built-in networking. In the rare cases where this might be
      needed, you can always throw the udeb on a floppy.
    - Remove nic-extra-modules from powerpc net-drivers. We've changed the
      module udebs so that all drivers likely to be needed on OldWorld are
      in nic-modules.
    - Move everything else from root-2 to net-drivers, and remove root-2.
  * Steve Langasek
    - Trim various unneeded udebs from the alpha netboot and cdrom
      initrds.
  * Thiemo Seufer

    - Add firewire-core-modules to the 2.6 kernel_specific nic-modules list, as
      used by i386, amd64, and powerpc, all of which were just changed so that
      nic-modules depend on firewire-modules for 2.6 kernels.
    - Remove ipv6-modules and wireless-tools-udeb from the i386 net-drivers
      floppy to get back under the floppy size limit. Closes: #261625
    - Numerous fixes and updates to the installer manual, including
      improved docs on PXE booting for i386 (Closes: #232252),
      rewritten section of downloading files that avoids bad links and
      outdated image names (Closes: #246890), document ramdisk_size for lilo

    - i386 kernel no longer support rarp, disable that in install manual.
      Closes: #250027 ; Same for hppa. Closes: #250026

    - Add usb-storage-modules and scsi-common-modules to the powerpc cdrom
      initrds.
    - Add cdrom-core-modules, input-modules, firewire-core-modules, and
      scsi-core-modules to the powerpc 2.6 cdrom initrds. Should actually
      work now.
    - Add pcmcia udebs to powerpc net_drivers floppy and netboot images.
    - Move $(TREE)/usr/lib/kernel-image-$(KERNELVERSION) out of the way to
      $(TEMP)/lib when building boot images. powerpc subarchitectures that
      need to use mkvmlinuz should now be able to do so.
    - For every initrd, output an initrd.list file containing the packages
      and their versions used to construct it.
    - debootstrap-udeb is now priority optional. Add it back into monolithic
      images.
    - Drop G5 images; power4 works on G5s as of linux-kernel-di-powerpc-2.6
      0.62. Build power4 netboot 2.6 images.
    - Remove install-safe and expert-safe targets, advising people to add
      'video=ofonly' instead. The -safe targets have got rather out of hand
      on full CDs, so I'd like to think about removing them there.
    - daily-build copies the previous build before rsyncing up the new one.
      This saved 82MB of upload for my powerpc build.
    - Add nic-shared-modules to powerpc netboot images, needed by
      nic-modules.
    - Bump powerpc 2.6 kernels to 2.6.7. Add firmware-modules, much as on
      i386.

    - Change netcfg/use_dhcp to netcfg/disable_dhcp in syslinux boot screens
      and elsewhere.
    - Update i386 to the 2.6.7 kernel.
    - Add firmware-modules to i386 images that have either nic-modules or
      scsi-modules on them. Make this happen only for the 2.6 kernel, using a
      nasty pkg-lists/kernel_specific technique since we lack dependency
      resolution in pkg-lists.
    - Go back to pulling udebs from unstable when building official images.
    - Produce a single hd-media boot image that includes both kernels.
    - Parameterise filenames and paths in the syslinux.cfg files so that
      files can have different names or locations.
    - Provide a pxeboot.tar.gz on i386 that can just be untarred into a

      TFTP boot.
    - Add socket-modules to the SWARM netboot image.
    - Temporarily remove modules for USB detection from the SWARM
      netboot images since we don't have the right kernel modules yet.
    - Remove fdisk-udeb from the mipsel netboot and cdrom images and
      from the arm netboot images.
    - Add little-endian netboot images for the SWARM.
    - Add a monolithic image for SWARM on mips and mipsel for testing
      purposes, but don't active it by default.
    - Add mdcfg-utils and mdadm-udeb to pkg-lists/monolithic/common;
      partman-md needs it.
    - Add lvm2-udeb and libdevmapper1.00-udeb to pkg-lists/monolithic/common
      for partman-lvm.
    - Build-depend on version 1.3-5 or higher of genext2fs in order to fix
      initrd problems found and fixed by Vince Sanders.
  * Bastian Blank
    - busybox is not longer kernel dependent.
    - Only call depmod if there are modules in the tree.
    - Make TEMP and DEST resolvable in the config.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - mips config cleanup, no changes in behaviour.
    - Cleanup the Makefile's System.map handling.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add cdrom-core-modules to hd-media as it is not on the iso,
      and partman needs to find cdroms to set up the fstab properly.
    - Add pcmcia-storage-modules to the cd-drivers floppy. The rest of pcmcia
      support is too lasge to fit on the floppy, so for now the net-drivers
      floppy will also have to be loaded to access pcmcia cdroms.
    - Update i386 kernel to 2.4.26 (with the SATA backports).
    - Add sata-modules to hd-media and to the isolinux image.
    - Add nic-usb-modules to net-drivers floppy.
    - Document noapic on f5.txt. Closes: #238609
    - Set apt to retry 3 times to guard against intermittent network problems
      and make builds more robust.
    - Move firewire stuff to isolinux CD initrd; the el-toritoc CD initrd
      is full.
    - Remove ppp-modules udeb from net_drivers floppy images, which do not
      have ppp-udeb on them.
    - Pull udebs from testing when building official images.
    - Disable monolithic image type on i386, because it is large, mostly
      useful for testing, and currenlty cannot build against testing because
      of a missing mdcfg-utils.
  * Colin Watson
    - Reduce the four cloned-and-hacked yaboot.conf files to one, with the
      type substituted in at build time.
    - Remove redundant discover1-udeb and discover1-data-udeb from powerpc
      monolithic list.
    - Add cramfs initrd support.
    - Add support for powerpc 2.6 installs, currently monolithic-only.
    - stats targets cope with TEMP_INITRD being empty.
    - powerpc-small root floppy was out of space; split off an asian-root
      floppy, the same as we already have for i386. Closes: #246958
    - Drop console-keymaps-amiga from non-apus powerpc initrds.
    - Add lvmcfg-utils to pkg-lists/monolithic/common for now; partman-lvm
      needs it.
    - Arrange for there actually to be a kernel on the powerpc-small boot
      floppy again. This is slightly moot, though, as we don't have miboot
      yet so it's still not bootable ...
    - Add eject-udeb to powerpc CDs.
    - Comment out powerpc monolithic target again, since the images tarball
      is already quite enormous enough and monolithic is mainly intended for
      developer testing.
    - Add leading slash to "etc/hostname" in manual (closes: #249101).
  * Steve Langasek
    - Change netboot target for alpha now that netabootwrap is in the
      archive, and add an appropriate versioned build-dep.

    - Access floppy is out of space, so drop all non-English text from

    - For the monolithic target, include all kernel module udebs matching the
      kernel from localudebs, and also any non-kernel udebs, automatically, to
      make building custom kernels easier
    - Add a pkg-lists/kernel_specific, for 2.4 and 2.6, currently
      discover varies depending on the kernel major version, and there is a
      hack to use module-init-tools over busybox for 2.6.
    - Also add a kernel_specific isa-pnp-modules list, since 2.4 has the
      module and package, and 2.6 does not.
    - Add a new field to pkg-lists to get the kernel major version, and a
      KERNELMAJOR variable.
    - Add a monolithic_2.6 image type, a hd-media_2.6, and a netboot_2.6,
      none currently on by default, that use the 2.6 kernel. So far for i386
      only.

    - Change to discover1 and discover1-data udebs, as part of the discover
      transition.

  * Joey Hess
    - Move countrychooser off of the i386 root floppy, and onto
      the net-drivers and cd-drivers floppys, freeing 50k.
      load-floppy now runs before it.
    - Reenable all translations for root floppy again, though this can't last.
    - Always include /dev/console, even for images that will use devfs.
      This means that netboot users will not have to remember the devfs=mount.
    - Left devfs=mount in syslinux.cfg anyway, out of general caution.
    - Add another dh_testroot call before udebs are downloaded.
    - Document debian-installer/probe/usb=false in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Docs are now included in the source package.
    - Remove the INSTALLATION-HOWTO copy hack.
    - Add docbook, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl, xsltproc to build deps.
    - Add the installation manual to the image tarballs.
    - Use svn up in daily-build; we moved to subversion.
    - Allow passing languages and arches to manual/build/build.sh in env
      variables.
  * dann frazier
    - Fix installs w/ USB keyboards w/ ia64 cdroms.  Add input-modules to the
      pkglist, and fix ia64.cfg, which was pointing at the non-smp kernel.
      This caused the build to put modules.dep in the wrong directory, causing
      modprobe to fail - will need linux-kernel-di 0.50 to build.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Add nic-shared-modules to nativehd/m68k pkg-list.
    - Update m68k demo.cfg to fix build problem.
    - Bumped amiga to 2.4.25, all other subarchs 2.2.25.

    - Add input-modules to ia64 netboot and cdrom lists. Needed for USB
      keyboard.
    - Add missing usb-discover to ia64 cdrom.
    - Add a kernel to the demo image type, because this is necessary to get
      the System.map so depmod will work on 2.6. The kernel is currently
      included in the demo image; I suppose you could use it somehow, and I
      didn't want to risk breaking builds by removing it.
    - Add alpha and s390 to the arch list, in case someone want to try to get
      them working for the release.

  * Joey Hess

    - Do not library reduce the CDs against net-drivers, only cd-drivers.
      It was making the el torito ones too large, and it is unnecessary.
    - Add $(TREE)/usr/lib to mklibs search path, so it can find
      libdebconfclient0.
    - Turn on hppa in debian/control.
    - Add libiw27 to build depends, as netcfg has a versioned dep on it.
      Not actually used though.

    - Switch i386 to the 2.4.25 kernel.
    - Add libdebian-installer4 to build-deps. This is because
      libdebian-installer4 cannot do versioned provudes, and some
      udebs have versioned deps on libdebian-installer4.
  * Some m68k changes.

debian-installer (20040301) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add some support for subtypes of images that have their pkg-lists
      derived from another type.
    - Add a cdrom/isolinux subtype that includes all the SCSI disk drivers,
      and build the cdrom initrd using this type. The cdrom boot.img still
      uses the smaller initrd so it will still fit on El Torito.
    - Removed the xfs flavoured cdrom, since 2.4.25 will have xfs standard.
    - Add m68k as an arch in the control file.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Fixed broken sparc32_netboot build. Same fix as the one for 
      sparc64_netboot.

      conditionalise with VERSIONED_SYSTEM_MAP
    - sparc: Define VERSIONED_SYSTEM_MAP
    - sparc: Define EXTRANAME in netboot.cfg
    - daily-build: Use rm -rf for removing daily directory
    - sparc: Define netboot as separate for sparc32 and sparc64 until
      tilo works again.
    - sparc: Setup miniiso target.  ths says that this is the Right Thing.
    - sparc: Remove cdrom target.
    - sparc: Add demo target.
    - tftpboot.sh: Accept sparc64 as a reasonable alias for sun4u.

    - m68k: add m68k to floppy pkg-lists.
  * Joey Hess
    - add support for pkg-lists/*/local files (not in CVS), for building
      test images
    - di-utils is now part of base
    - fix pcmcia-config-reduce call
    - set the syslinux timeout to 0 on floppys, to match the CD
    - put syslinux boot screens back on boot floppy and hd-media
    - copy System.map to $(TEMP) instead of deleting it, I understand sparc
      needs this
    - add the libiw27-udeb to every list that includes netcfg
    - add libdebconfclient to pkg-lists/base; it is marginally smaller than
      having mklibs copy in the system one. Remove build-dep.
    - same for libdebian-installer-4-udeb, although it is not currently any
      smaller
    - before running mklibs, copy all the libs from lib and usr/lib in the
      initrd to a temporary directory, and add that to mklib's search path
      with -L. This will make it avoid copying in large versions of libs from
      the build system if there is already a small version available in the
      initrd.
    - removed the slow, buggy code that added unneccessary and often wrong
      "-reduced" entries to the status file

    - upgrade to 2.4.24 for alpha kernels
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Remove dead apt-get code in the Makefile.

    - Add syslinux splash image by Matthew A. Nicholson, and another by
      Klowner, and still another by Volkan YAZICI.
    - Make all the syslinux help screens leave graphics mode when displayed.
    - Hack syslinux.txt so it all fits on one line, the same line as the boot:
      prompt.
    - Add ${BOOTPROMPT} expansion to bootscreen-subst, to make it easy 
      to make the last line in a syslinux screen not have a newline at EOF
      on the image, while still being easily editable.
    - Switch cdroms from load-installer to load-cdrom. This is to work around
      limitations in main-menu (see #218774). Driver floppy loading will now
      be started by cdrom-detect if it fails to find a CD.
    - Version the mtools build-dep. Closes: #225584
    - Let HOST, BASEDIR, or DIR be set in the environment before running
      daily-build, to override the defaults.
    - Fix up miniiso creation to fit into the new build system better.
    - Turn on miniiso creation for netboot, so there is a
      dest/netboot/mini.iso that behaves the same as a netboot would.
    - Add a dest/cdrom/debian-cd_info.tar.gz with the syslinux screens
      and splash image, for eventual use by debian-cd.
    - Convert the miniiso to use isolinux, to support any size initrd.
    - Improvements to manifest generation and formatting.

    - Increase ia64 'floppy' image to 10MB, and initrd to 24MB
    - hppa: Add config/type/netboot-hppa, so TYPE=netboot generates a lifimage
    - hppa: include fdisk-udeb in pkglists so we can partition.
    - hppa: include text frontend, as it is useful for debugging.
    - hppa: fix up palo cmdline for netboot lifimage

    - Generate bootable hd-media images, not just the initrd.
      These can be written directly the usb memory stick, then mounted
      and a d-i iso copied in. As they're quite big (and sparse),
      they are gzipped.
    - NB: The above change means you need 128+ mb more free space to
      build this package on i386.
    - If System.map is included in the kernel image udeb, pass it to depmod
      via -F and delete it when done. This is to support building on systems
      running 2.6.
    - Remove ide modules stuff from net drivers floppy. I don't know why it
      was there, but its deps were not met and this could cause ugly messages 
      during install.
    - Remove the same ide modules from i386 netboot.
    - Document the bootkbd boot parameter in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Add "expert" mode boot to syslinux, which sets DEBCONF_PRIORITY=low.
    - Include a doc/index.en.html in the install-images tarball, so
      debian-cd will find some documentation and not include the boot floppies
      docs.
    - Include INSTALLATION-HOWTO there too, by way of a gross, gross hack.
    - netcfg reorg
    - scsi-common-modules reorg
    - Grep out several encodings that confuse reduce-font:
      ISO-8859-*, EUC-JP, CP1251. This is a temporary hackaround to get it
      building again.
    - Access floppy filled up, so move the network stuff to the access_drivers
      floppy. That filled up access_drivers, so comment out SCSI support at
      least for now.
    - Turn ia64 back on, let's see if it builds now.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Build the demo tree only for architectures which support it.

      create them at the rule's end.
    - Ignore errors for the all_clean target.

    - Switch i386 to using dhcp-client rather than pump for netboot.
      Left it using pump on other arches that did not already use dhcp-client,

    - Switch i386, hppa, and ia64 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp
      on the root floppy.
    - Switch powerpc to pump on the root floppy.
    - Switch i386 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp on the access floppy.
    - Switch from pump to dhcp-client on powerpc.
    - Add disk labels to the i386 floppy images, for use by the bootfloppy
      initrd, and maybe later by the floppy retreiver, etc.
    - In debian/rules, if the changelog is unreleased, use unstable as the
      DISTRIBUTION.
    - makelabel takes the build date as its second parameter. Calculating
      BUILD_DATE once at the start to avoid inconsistencies during
      long/midnight builds.
    - Add MEDIA_TYPE to configs for bootable image types.
    - Add DEBIAN_VERSION to config.
    - Add bootscreen-subst to substitute these variables into boot screens.
    - Make a syslinux help screen, for all i386 syslinuxed boot media.
      Includes the build date, debian version, and media type, and is derived
      from isolinux help texts on the sarge cds, but modified to actually
      match d-i:
        - remove boot flavor docs, as we currently have no flavors
        - remove rescue stuff, as d-i is not currently also a rescue disk
        - reduce number of colors used for cleaner look
        - remove mention of non-free
        - try to make the prerequisites documentation somewhere close to
          reality -- 64 mb ram and 256 mb disk.
        - make every boot message screen 22 lines long, followed by a blank
          line (which is in turn followed by the boot: prompt), for consistent
          display
        - remove references in f4.txt to a nonexistant table
        - remove documentation of mono and vga16:off, as they do not work with
          d-i
        - remove keytimer hack documentation, that was for boot-floppies
        - add documentation of d-i's boot time parameters, including the new
          debian-installer/framebuffer=false
        - remove the mailing list subscription info; boot time is not the
          time to tell the user about this. In its place, make f9.txt be
          about Debian.
      - Remove DEBCONF_DEBUG setting from syslinux.cfg.
      - Use bootscreen-subst on powerpc's boot.msg, too.
      - Comment out the udeb apt status file stuff in get-packages, now is not
        the time to be breaking the build with that.
      - Build depend on elilo on ia64. This had better be the last one.

debian-installer (20031113) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add new loop-modules to bootfloppy, hd-media.
    - Move input-modules from root floppy to bootfloppy, as the new
      rootskel-bootfloppy prompts for the user to hit enter.
    - Remove redundant usb-discover and usb-modules from root floppy;
      the boot floppy takes care of that.
    - Remove fat-modules and floppy-modules from the root floppy; they
      boot floppy loads them.
    - Create DEST before copying in DEST_KERNEL.
    - ia64 build-depends on dosfstools. Closes: #219919
    - sparc build-depends on genromfs. Closes: #220208
    - remove brltty from everything except access. It is causing problems
      (#219928) on sparc at least.
    - add nic-extra-modules to netboot for i386, as it fits and netboot
      should support as much as it can
    - try to get full UTF-8 going on netboot
    - add nano to netboot
  * Richard Hirst
    - Add mtools as a build-dep for ia64

debian-installer (20031029) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This includes a deb that lets a demo of the installer be run
    (and triggers autobuilders), but the main payload is the
    debian-installer-images tarball, which is designed to be unpacked
    by ftp-master into the ftp site.
  * Set architecture to i386, powerpc for now. More will be added
    once d-i works on them well enough to distribute images.
