* Add disk labels to non-i386 floppys.
* The busybox in the bootfloppy can be linked with uclibc and/or statically
  to make it smaller. Only the linuxrc uses it, so it doesn't really
  matter. This could save up to 200k on the boot floppy. But first someone
  needs to add code to install uclibc or a uclibc udeb.
* The apt download fails if the dpkg status file of the build system is
  in an inconsistent state. It could be overridden to use another status
  file, but that file would have to claim that all dependancies of the
  udebs it's downloading were met. Hmm.
* Change mklibs to not pull in libraries from the build system, and only
  act on libraries in the tree; those libraries would then be provided by
  udebs; this would be cleaner in several ways (and it's why eg anna
  depends on libc-udeb already).
* Convert the driver floppies to use FAT filesystem, not ext2, on i386.
  Makes it easier for third parties to throw additional udebs on.
* Cache the upxed kernel, to avoid re-upxing it over and over.
* The localudebs stuff is a hack, and would be batter handled by using
  apt-ftparchive to set up an apt repository based on files in localudebs,
  and let apt know about it by adding that to sources.list.udeb. Then the
  ugly caveat in README could be removed.
* Too much unnecessary code and data duplication between i386 and amd64.
