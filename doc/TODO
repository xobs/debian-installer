Asked ftp-master to propigate already:
	- libdebian-installer 0.20 (powerpc, mips)
	
To propigate to testing:
	- silo-installer 0.0.4 (sparc)
	- yaboot-installer 0.0.15 (powerpc)
	- partitioner 0.22 (mips)
	- base-installer 0.062 (mips)
	- arcboot-installer 0.008 (mips)
	- linux-kernel-di-powerpc (powerpc; all udebs)
	- kernel-patch-2.4.25-powerpc 2.4.25-4 (deb; powerpc)
	- fixed kbd-chooser (#239035)


Status for different parts of debian-installer.  The numbers are
approximate (as in +/- 50%) and may change in any direction, at any
time.

[0%] Not begun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Some kind of a mechanism for udebs to declare what parts of
	  busybox they need, so we can ensure that all deps are met while
	  keeping the busybox footprint small.
          Packages depending on base-installer should use the
	  utilities in /target so we can keep busybox's size down.
	  (We will probably ship without this.)
	- ppp support
	  Not as important for analog dialup, as for ISDN, pppoe.
	- some architectures
		arm
		hurd-i386
		sh
		s/390

[30%] Might need large rewrites. Current implementation might
      work by accident
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - user documentation
		Short term we have the INSTALLATION-HOWTO, but the real
		install manual is still being put together.
        - GUI frontend to cdebconf.
		There are some basic implementations. The trick is to make
		it a GUI that does not suck, while still using debconf
		underneath.
	- some architectures
		hppa
		mipsel
		
[60%] Needs some work, but does its grunt work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- I18N
		Mostly done, still filling in minor holes.
	- translations
		Varying languages translated to varying degrees.
		http://people.debian.org/~barbier/debian-installer/l10n/
	- language-chooser
		The perennial problem is how to order/present the list of
		languages. Many complaints, but it works.
        - boot loader installers (lilo, grub, etc)
		Work, except for when they don't. See BTS.
        - base system installer
		debootstrap is stable, and has quite good support in
                base-installer
		Except for when it fails. See BTS.
	- anna
		Works, mostly.  Needs support for Release files.
		Support for signed Release files would be cool, but
		needs gpgv-udeb.
		Needs to have load-installer properly split out of the anna
		binary to save space on root floppy. Or removed, not used
		anymore.
        - disk selector, partitioner
		There are three of them, autopartkit, partkit, and partman.
		All of them work, except for when they don't. (See BTS.)
	- wireless support
		- configurator newly available, needs testing
 		- wireless-tools-udeb is available, but is not loaded by default
		  on netinst CD
	- post-reboot configuration
		base-cofig is stable, though stuff may need to be added to
		it to handle things d-i doesn't bother with. i18n is
                needed. Some questions repeat questions from d-i.
	- linda support for udebs, to catch all the common gotchas
		(lintian support in progress)
	- web site
		http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
		Could be better laid out, lacking some sections, other
		parts are quite good.
	- archive integration
		Only a few arches (i386, powerpc, ia64) have boot media in
		the archive.
		Last kinks in unstable/testing separation for d-i still being
		worked out.
	- pcmcia support
		- may work, may not.. (many failure reports)
		- Probably need to re-run hw-detect after loading pcmcia from
		  the net_driver floppy.
	- low memory support
		Where "low" is 32-46 mb!
		Works, but user must be careful to set up swap ASAP.
		There is no sanity checking, and some bad failure modes.
	- some architectures
		i386
		ia64
		powerpc (some subarches)
		mips
			- problems with partitioning, CD images, arcboot
			- netboot and basic install works, if you know what
			  you're doing
		m68k (some subarches)
			- mac fully working
			- amiga building, untested
		alpha
			- needs TLC
		sparc

[90%] Single missing important feature or bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- hw-detect
		Working but needs to be switched over to discover2
	- iso-scan
		Works, but does not flag the disk the iso is mounted from
		as unusable by the rest of the installer.
	- kernel-package integration
		Moving to the new linux-kernel-di system. Not all arches
		use it yet.
        - netcfg
		Working, pending rewrite for IPv6.
	- bts
		Still need a non-manual way to tag our bugs.
        - library reduction
		Still breaking from time to time.	

[100%] Those shouldn't need to be touched any more

Common problems and transitions
===============================

This is a list of common mistakes that need to be corrected throughout the
code base:

  * All debconf commands that INPUT, GO, GET or SET questions should check
    their return value. This is pure evil:

    debconf->command(debconf, "GET", "mirror/suite", NULL); /* unchecked return code ! */
    asprintf(&command, "foo %s", debconf->value);
    system(command);

  * Nothing should send error messages to stderr. If there is an error,
    use debconf to display a message. stderr messages will overwrite the
    newt frontend.

  * cdebconf's debconfclient.h has a set of macros for calling debconf
    (debconf_get() and so on)
    These should perhaps be used consistently throughout the code for
    clarity.

  * There needs to be a centralised logging method. Syslog will do, but
    we currently have a lot of nasty code that appends messages to
    /var/log/messages directly. All of that would be converted to pipe it
    to logger. However, this is a problem, because piping a command to
    logger loses the exit status of the command. Need some way to run a
    command, logging the ouput to syslog, w/o losing exit status.

  * udebs should not include md5sums files, or postrm, prerm, preinst
    scripts. This includes ones generated by debhelper.

  * Use the cdebconf error template type for error messages, instead of
    note.
  
  * Most debconf title setting can be replaced with providing the
    appropriate title template and letting main-menu set it.
