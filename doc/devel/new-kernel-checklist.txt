This is a checklist of steps involved in updating d-i to use a new version
of the kernel.

 1. New kernel deb enters the archive.
 2. Update linux-kernel-di package to use new kernel.
 3. Compare available modules in new kernel and add any that are useful for
    installation to an appropriate udeb.
 4. Update build/config/ KERNELVERSION to use new kernel (only commit once
    udebs are accepted).
 5. Make sure images still build, as sometimes new kernels will overflow
    floppies, etc. If not go back to step 3 and refactor.
 6. Do initial test installs, which must be done against unstable to
    use the new kernel udebs from unstable or using hand-build CD
    images.
 7. Get ftp-master to remove kernel udebs for the old kernel version from
    unstable. Before this is done netinst CDs will be larger than usual.
 8. New kernel deb enters testing. 
 9. Update rootskel's debian-installer/kernel/image and/or
    debian-installer/kernel/image-2.6 templates to use the version number
    of the new kernel. (Not necessary for all arches.)
10. Update base-installer's postinst to change any hard-coded kernel
    versions. (Not necessary for all arches.)
11. Update debian-cd's tasks/debian-installer+kernel, tasks/debian-installer,
    and tasks/exclude-sarge for new kernel.
12. Test to make sure 24, 32, and 48 mb installs still work. New kernels
    and added/changed modules sometimes break lowmem.
13. Get new debian-cd uploaded and into testing.
14. Get ftp-master to propagate all the updated udebs into testing.
    Until this point, naive users will be unable to use some sid_d-i
    install images as the needed udebs will not be in testing.
15. Full user testing, etc.
16. Get ftp-master to remove kernel udebs for the old kernel version
    from testing. This will *break* some old released install media
    (floppy, netboot, not cdrom), but it's necessary before release.
17. Update kernel version in installer/doc/manual/build/buildone.sh for
    relevant architecture(s).
18. Inform maintainer of Release Notes of the changes in kernel version
    (or update ddp/manuals.sgml/release-notes/release-notes.ent in CVS).
