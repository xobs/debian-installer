A few historical bits about d-i development
-------------------------------------------

No idea where this will lead us, but on a quiet morning in July 2005,
I imagined it would be worth keeping track of D-I history, so I just
started this document to keep the information I've found.

Please throw in any interesting information you might have. We'll
think about organizing this stuff as soon as we have enough material.



Original announcement of the D-I project:
 First mention found: http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2000/06/msg00279.html

 Interesting quote from it: Joey Hess said '..."debian-installer", or
 some actual cool name someone comes up with. I hate naming
 projects. :-)'. It seems that the name was quite good after all...:-)

First "weekly" status report:
