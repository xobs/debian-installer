"#### Startup.\n"
"\n"
"# To use a preseed file, you'll first need to boot the installer,\n"
"# and tell it what preseed file to use. This is done by passing the\n"
"# kernel a boot parameter, either manually at boot or by editing the\n"
"# syslinux.cfg (or similar) file and adding the parameter to the end\n"
"# of the append line(s) for the kernel.\n"
"#\n"
"# If you're netbooting, use this:\n"
"#   preseed/url=http://host/path/to/preseed\n"
"# If you're remastering a CD, you could use this:\n"
"#   preseed/file=/cdrom/preseed\n"
"# If you're installing from USB media, use this, and put the preseed file\n"
"# in the toplevel directory of the USB stick.\n"
"#   preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed\n"
"# Be sure to copy this file to the location you specify.\n"
"#\n"
"# Some parts of the installation process cannot be automated using\n"
"# some forms of preseeding, because the questions are asked before\n"
"# the preseed file is loaded. For example, if the preseed file is\n"
"# downloaded over the network, the network setup must be done first.\n"
"# One reason to use initrd preseeding is that it allows preseeding\n"
"# of even these early steps of the installation process.\n"
"#\n"
"# If a preseed file cannot be used to preseed some steps, the install can\n"
"# still be fully automated, since you can pass preseed values to the kernel\n"
"# on the command line. Just pass path/to/var=value for any of the preseed\n"
"# variables listed below.\n"
"#\n"
"# While you're at it, you may want to throw a debconf/priority=critical in\n"
"# there, to avoid most questions even if the preseeding below misses some.\n"
"# And you might set the timeout to 1 in syslinux.cfg to avoid needing to "
"hit\n"
"# enter to boot the installer.\n"
"#\n"
"# Note that the kernel accepts a maximum of 8 command line options and\n"
"# 8 environment options (including any options added by default for the\n"
"# installer). If these numbers are exceeded, 2.4 kernels will drop any\n"
"# excess options and 2.6 kernels will panic. With kernel 2.6.9 or newer,\n"
"# you can use 32 command line options and 32 environment options.\n"
"#\n"
"# Some of the default options, like 'vga=normal' may be safely removed\n"
"# for most installations, which may allow you to add more options for\n"
"# preseeding.\n"
"\n"
"# It is not possible to use preseeding to set language, country, and\n"
"# keyboard. Instead you should use kernel parameters. Example:\n"
"# languagechooser/language-name=English\n"
"# countrychooser/shortlist=US\n"
"# console-keymaps-at/keymap=us\n"
"\n"
"#### Network configuration.\n"
"\n"
"# Of course, this won't work if you're loading your preseed file from the\n"
"# network! But it's great if you're booting from CD or USB stick. You can\n"
"# also pass network config parameters in on the kernel params if you are\n"
"# loading preseed files from the network.\n"
"\n"
"# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it\n"
"# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.\n"
"d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto\n"
"\n"
"# If you have a slow dhcp server and the installer times out waiting for\n"
"# it, this might be useful.\n"
"#d-i netcfg/dhcp_timeout string 60\n"
"\n"
"# If you prefer to configure the network manually, here's how:\n"
"#d-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean true\n"
"#d-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 192.168.1.1\n"
"#d-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 192.168.1.42\n"

"#d-i netcfg/get_gateway string 192.168.1.1\n"
"#d-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# Note that any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take\n"
"# precedence over values set here. However, setting the values still\n"
"# prevents the questions from being shown even if values come from dhcp.\n"
"d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname\n"

"#### Partitioning.\n"
"\n"
"# If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition \\\n"
"#    select Use the largest continuous free space\n"
"\n"
"# Alternatively, you can specify a disk to partition. The device name can\n"
"# be given in either devfs or traditional non-devfs format.\n"
"# For example, to use the first disk devfs knows of:\n"
"d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/discs/disc0/disc\n"
"\n"
"# You can choose from any of the predefined partitioning recipes:\n"
"d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select \\\n"
"     All files in one partition (recommended for new users)\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select Desktop machine\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select Multi-user workstation\n"
"\n"
"# Or provide a recipe of your own...\n"
"# The recipe format is documented in the file devel/partman-auto-recipe."
"txt.\n"
"# If you have a way to get a recipe file into the d-i environment, you can\n"
"# just point at it.\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe_file string /hd-media/recipe\n"
"\n"
"# If not, you can put an entire recipe in one line. This example creates\n"
"# a small /boot partition, suitable swap, and uses the rest of the space\n"
"# for the root partition:\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string boot-root :: \\\n"
"#    20 50 100 ext3 $primary{ } $bootable{ } method{ format } format{ } \\\n"

"#    boot-root ::\n"
"#       40 50 100 ext3\n"
"#          $primary{ } $bootable{ }\n"

"\n"
"# Grub is the default boot loader (for x86). If you want lilo installed\n"
"# instead, uncomment this:\n"
"#d-i grub-installer/skip boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the "
"MBR\n"
"# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.\n"
"d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if if finds some other "
"OS\n"
"# too, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.\n"
"d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# Alternatively, if you want to install to a location other than the mbr,\n"
"# uncomment and edit these lines:\n"

"#### Shell commands.\n"
"\n"
"# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks\n"
"# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a\n"
"# preseed file like this one. Only use preseed files from trusted\n"
"# locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful, here's\n"
"# a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,\n"
"# automatically.\n"
"\n"
"# This first command is run as early as possible, just after\n"
"# preseeding is read.\n"
"#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb\n"

"\n"
"# This command is run just as base-config is starting up.\n"
"#base-config base-config/early_command string echo hi mom\n"
"\n"
"# This command is run after base-config is done, just before the login:\n"

"\n"
"#### Clock and time zone setup.\n"
"\n"
"# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.\n"
"#base-config tzconfig/gmt boolean true\n"
"# If you told the installer that you're in the United States, then you\n"

"\n"
"#### Account setup.\n"
"\n"
"# To preseed the root password, you have to put it in the clear in this\n"

"# Available tasks as of this writing include: Desktop environment,\n"
"# Web server, Print server, DNS server, File server, Mail server,\n"
"# SQL database, Laptop, Standard system, manual package selection. The\n"
