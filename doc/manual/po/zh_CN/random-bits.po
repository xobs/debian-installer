"#    select Use the largest continuous free space\n"
"\n"
"# Alternatively, you can specify a disk to partition. The device name can\n"

"# For example, to use the first disk devfs knows of:\n"
"d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/discs/disc0/disc\n"

"# You can choose from any of the predefined partitioning recipes:\n"
"d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select \\\n"

"#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select Desktop machine\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select Multi-user workstation\n"

"# Or provide a recipe of your own...\n"
"# The recipe format is documented in the file devel/partman-auto-recipe."

"# just point at it.\n"
"#d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe_file string /hd-media/recipe\n"

"# Grub is the default boot loader (for x86). If you want lilo installed\n"
"# instead, uncomment this:\n"
"#d-i grub-installer/skip boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the "
"MBR\n"
"# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.\n"
"d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true\n"
"\n"
"# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if if finds some other "

"# too, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.\n"

"#### Shell commands.\n"
"\n"
"# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks\n"
"# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a\n"
"# preseed file like this one. Only use preseed files from trusted\n"
"# locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful, here's\n"
"# a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,\n"
"# automatically.\n"
"\n"
"# This first command is run as early as possible, just after\n"
"# preseeding is read.\n"
"#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb\n"

"\n"
"# This command is run just as base-config is starting up.\n"
"#base-config base-config/early_command string echo hi mom\n"
"\n"
"# This command is run after base-config is done, just before the login:\n"
"# prompt. This is a good way to install a set of packages you want, or to\n"

"\n"
"#### Clock and time zone setup.\n"
"\n"
"# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.\n"
"#base-config tzconfig/gmt boolean true\n"

"# question.\n"
"#base-config tzconfig/choose_country_zone_single boolean true\n"
"# This question is asked as a fallback for countries other than those\n"
"# listed above, which have more than one time zone. You can preseed one of\n"
"# the time zones, or \"other\".\n"
"#base-config tzconfig/choose_country_zone_multiple select\n"
"\n"
"#### Account setup.\n"
"\n"
"# To preseed the root password, you have to put it in the clear in this\n"

"# If you want to skip creation of a normal user account.\n"

"# And their password, but use caution!\n"
"#passwd passwd/user-password password insecure\n"

"#### Apt setup.\n"
"\n"

"# Available tasks as of this writing include: Desktop environment,\n"
"# Web server, Print server, DNS server, File server, Mail server,\n"
"# SQL database, Laptop, Standard system, manual package selection. The\n"
"# last of those will run aptitude. You can also choose to install no\n"

"# way. We recommend always including the Standard system task.\n"
"tasksel tasksel/first multiselect Desktop environment, Standard system\n"

"#### Mailer configuration.\n"
"\n"

"#### X Configuration.\n"
"\n"
"# Preseeding Debian's X config is possible, but you probably need to know\n"
"# some details about the video hardware of the machine, since Debian's X\n"
"# configurator does not do fully automatic configuration of everything.\n"

"# over and over. So if it's preseeded to be done, there is a possibility of\n"
"# an infinite loop if the mouse is not autodetected.\n"

"# syslinux.cfg (or similar) file and adding the parameter to the end\n"
"# of the append line(s) for the kernel.\n"
"#\n"
"# If you're netbooting, use this:\n"
"#   preseed/url=http://host/path/to/preseed\n"

"# in the toplevel directory of the USB stick.\n"
"#   preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed\n"

"#\n"
"# If a preseed file cannot be used to preseed some steps, the install can\n"

"#\n"
"# If a preseed file cannot be used to preseed some steps, the install can\n"
