"At a bare minimum, GNU/Linux needs one partition for itself. You can have a "
"single partition containing the entire operating system, applications, and "
"your personal files. Most people feel that a separate swap partition is also "
"a necessity, although it's not strictly true. <quote>Swap</quote> is scratch "
"space for an operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage "
"as <quote>virtual memory</quote>. By putting swap on a separate partition, "
"Linux can make much more efficient use of it. It is possible to force Linux "
"to use a regular file as swap, but it is not recommended."

"Most people choose to give GNU/Linux more than the minimum number of "
"partitions, however. There are two reasons you might want to break up the "
"file system into a number of smaller partitions. The first is for safety. If "
"something happens to corrupt the file system, generally only one partition "
"is affected. Thus, you only have to replace (from the backups you've been "
"carefully keeping) a portion of your system. At a bare minimum, you should "
"consider creating what is commonly called a <quote>root partition</quote>. "
"This contains the most essential components of the system. If any other "
"partitions get corrupted, you can still boot into GNU/Linux to fix the "
"system. This can save you the trouble of having to reinstall the system from "
"scratch."

"The second reason is generally more important in a business setting, but it "
"really depends on your use of the machine. For example, a mail server "
"getting spammed with e-mail can easily fill a partition. If you made "
"<filename>/var/mail</filename> a separate partition on the mail server, most "
"of the system will remain working even if you get spammed."

"The only real drawback to using more partitions is that it is often "
"difficult to know in advance what your needs will be. If you make a "
"partition too small then you will either have to reinstall the system or you "
"will be constantly moving things around to make room in the undersized "
"partition. On the other hand, if you make the partition too big, you will be "
"wasting space that could be used elsewhere. Disk space is cheap nowadays, "
"but why throw your money away?"
