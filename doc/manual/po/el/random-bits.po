"#### Startup.\n"
"\n"
"# To use a preseed file, you'll first need to boot the installer,\n"
"# and tell it what preseed file to use. This is done by passing the\n"
"# kernel a boot parameter, either manually at boot or by editing the\n"
"# syslinux.cfg (or similar) file and adding the parameter to the end\n"
"# of the append line(s) for the kernel.\n"
"#\n"
"# If you're netbooting, use this:\n"
"#   preseed/url=http://host/path/to/preseed\n"
"# If you're remastering a CD, you could use this:\n"
"#   preseed/file=/cdrom/preseed\n"
"# If you're installing from USB media, use this, and put the preseed file\n"
"# in the toplevel directory of the USB stick.\n"
"#   preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed\n"
"# Be sure to copy this file to the location you specify.\n"
"#\n"
"# Some parts of the installation process cannot be automated using\n"
"# some forms of preseeding, because the questions are asked before\n"
"# the preseed file is loaded. For example, if the preseed file is\n"
"# downloaded over the network, the network setup must be done first.\n"
"# One reason to use initrd preseeding is that it allows preseeding\n"
"# of even these early steps of the installation process.\n"
"#\n"
"# If a preseed file cannot be used to preseed some steps, the install can\n"
"# still be fully automated, since you can pass preseed values to the kernel\n"
"# on the command line. Just pass path/to/var=value for any of the preseed\n"
"# variables listed below.\n"
"#\n"
"# While you're at it, you may want to throw a debconf/priority=critical in\n"
"# there, to avoid most questions even if the preseeding below misses some.\n"
"# And you might set the timeout to 1 in syslinux.cfg to avoid needing to "
"hit\n"
"# enter to boot the installer.\n"
"#\n"
"# Note that the kernel accepts a maximum of 8 command line options and\n"
"# 8 environment options (including any options added by default for the\n"
"# installer). If these numbers are exceeded, 2.4 kernels will drop any\n"
"# excess options and 2.6 kernels will panic. With kernel 2.6.9 or newer,\n"
"# you can use 32 command line options and 32 environment options.\n"
"#\n"
"# Some of the default options, like 'vga=normal' may be safely removed\n"
"# for most installations, which may allow you to add more options for\n"
"# preseeding.\n"
"\n"
"# It is not possible to use preseeding to set language, country, and\n"
