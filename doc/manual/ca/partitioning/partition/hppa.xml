  <sect2 arch="hppa"><title>Partitioning for &arch-title;</title>
<para>

PALO, the HPPA boot loader, requires a partition of type <quote>F0</quote> somewhere
in the first 2GB.  This is where the boot loader and an optional kernel
and RAMdisk will be stored, so make it big enough for that &mdash; at least
4Mb (I like 8&ndash;16MB).  An additional requirement of the firmware is that
the Linux kernel must reside within the first 2GB of the disk.  This
is typically achieved by making the root ext2 partition fit entirely
within the first 2GB of the disk.  Alternatively you can create a small
ext2 partition near the start of the disk and mount that on
<filename>/boot</filename>, since that is the directory where the Linux
kernel(s) will be stored.  <filename>/boot</filename> needs to be big enough
to hold whatever kernels you might wish load; 8&ndash;16MB is generally
sufficient.
