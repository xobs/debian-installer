 <chapter id="d-i-intro"><title>Using the Debian Installer</title>

 <sect1><title>How the Installer Works</title>
<para>

The Debian Installer consists of a number of special-purpose
components to perform each installation task. Each component performs
its task, asking the user questions as necessary to do its job. If
there is no problem, the next component in the sequence takes over
without any user interaction (other than various progress messages).
When there is a problem, the user will see an error screen, and the
installer menu may be shown in order to select some alternative
action. If there are no problems, the user will never see the
installer menu, but will simply answer questions for each component
in turn. 

</para><para>

The questions themselves are given priorities, and the priority
of questions to be asked can be set. Thus if the installer knows
what to do, and the user need not be aware of other choices which
are available, then the installer will make the choice and not
display the question. Serious error notifications are set to 
priority 'critical' so the user will always be notified.

</para><para>

Power users may be more comfortable with a menu-driven interface,
where each step is controlled by the user rather than the installer
performing each step automatically in sequence. To use the installer
in a manual, menu-driven way, add the boot argument
<userinput>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium</userinput>.

</para><para>

The normal installer display is character-based (as opposed to the now
more familiar graphical interface). The mouse is not operational in
this environment. Here are the keys you can use to navigate within the
various dialogs.  The <keycap>right</keycap> arrow or
<keycap>Tab</keycap> key move `forward', and <keycap>left</keycap>
arrow or <keycombo> <keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>Tab</keycap>
</keycombo> move `backward' between displayed buttons and selections.
The <keycap>up</keycap> and <keycap>down</keycap> arrow select
different items within a scrollable list, and also scroll the list
itself. In addition, in long lists, you can type a letter to cause the
list to scroll directly to the section with items starting with the
letter you typed and use <keycap>Pg-Up</keycap> and
<keycap>Pg-Down</keycap> to scroll the list in sections.  The
<keycap>space bar</keycap> selects an item such as a checkbox.  Use
&enterkey; to activate choices.

</para><para arch="s390">

S/390 does not support virtual consoles. You may open a second and third
telnet session to view the logs described below.

</para><para>

Error messages are redirected to the third console (known as
<userinput>tty3</userinput>).  You can access this console by
pressing <keycombo><keycap>Left Alt</keycap><keycap>F3</keycap></keycombo>
(hold the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key while pressing the
<keycap>F3</keycap> function key); get back to
the main installer process with 
<keycombo><keycap>Left Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.

</para><para>

These messages can also be found in
<filename>/var/log/messages</filename>.  After installation, this log
is copied to <filename>/var/log/installer.log</filename> on your new
system. Other installation messages may be found in
<filename>/target/var/log/debian-installer/</filename> during the
installation, and <filename>/var/log/debian-installer/</filename>
after the computer has been booted into the installed system.

  <sect1 id="modules-list"><title>Components Introduction</title>
<para>

Here is a list of installer components with a brief description
of each component's purpose. Details you might need to know about
using a particular component are in <xref linkend="module-details"/>.

</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>

<term>main-menu</term><listitem><para>

Shows the list of components to the user during installer operation,
and starts a selected component when it is selected. Main-menu's
questions are set to priority MEDIUM, so if your priority is set to
HIGH or CRITICAL (HIGH is the default), you will not see the menu. On
the other hand, if there is an error which requires your intervention,
the question priority may be downgraded temporarily to allow you
to resolve the problem, and in that case the menu may appear.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>

<term>languagechooser</term><listitem><para>

Shows a list of languages and language variants. The installer will
display messages in the chosen language, unless the translation for
that language is not complete. When a translation is not complete,
English messages are shown.
