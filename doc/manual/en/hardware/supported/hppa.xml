<para>

The are two major support <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> flavors:
PA-RISC 1.1 and PA-RISC 2.0.  The PA-RISC 1.1 architecture is targeted
at 32-bit processors whereas the 2.0 architecture is targeted to
the 64-bit processors.  Some systems are able to run either kernel.
In both cases, the userland is 32-bit.  There is the possibility of
a 64-bit userland in the future.
