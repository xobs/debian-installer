 <title>Prompts During Software Installation</title>

<para>

Each package you selected with <command>tasksel</command> or
<command>aptitude</command> is
downloaded, unpacked and then installed in turn by the
<command>apt-get</command> and <command>dpkg</command> programs. If
a particular program needs more information from the user, it will
prompt you during this process. You might also want to keep an eye on
the output during the process, to watch for any installation errors
(although you will be asked to acknowledge errors which prevented
a package's installation).

  <title>Settings for the X Server</title>

On iMacs, and some older Macintoshes as well, the X Server software
doesn't calculate appropriate video settings. You will need to choose
the 'Advanced' option during configuration of the video settings. For
the monitor's horizontal sync range, enter 59-63. You can leave the
default for vertical refresh range.

The mouse device should be set to
