As the first step of the installation, select the language in which
you want the installation process to proceed. The language names
are listed in both English (left side) and in the language itself
(right side); the names on the right side are also shown in the proper
script for the language. The list is sorted on the English names.

The language you choose will be used for the rest of the installation
process, provided a translation of the different dialogs is available.
If no valid translation is available for the selected language, the
installer will default to English. The selected language will also be
used to help select a suitable keyboard layout.
