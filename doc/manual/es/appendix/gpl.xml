Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

</para>

 <sect2><title>Preamble</title>
<para>

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the gnu General Public License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software &mdash; to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the gnu Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
to your programs, too.

</para><para>

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.

</para><para>

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</para><para>

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</para><para>

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

</para><para>

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.

</para><para>

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

</para><para>

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

 <sect2><title>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</title>

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

</para>

<itemizedlist><listitem><para>

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

</para><para>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this
License along with the Program.

</para><para>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

</para><para>

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

</para><para>

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.

</para><para>

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)

</para><para>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

</para><para>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

</para><para>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

</para><para>

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,

</para><para>

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

</para><para>

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)

</para><para>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

</para><para>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

</para><para>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

</para><para>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

</para><para>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is
given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

</para><para>

NO WARRANTY

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no
warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or
other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any
kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
program is with you. should the program prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify
and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you
for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a
failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if
such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

 <sect2><title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>
<para>

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make
it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.

</para><para>

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</para><para>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the gnu General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.

</para><para>

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. See the gnu
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the gnu General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Gnomovision comes with absolutely no warranty; for details type `show

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items &mdash; whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine

proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want
to do, use the gnu Library General Public License instead of this
License.

   Se permite la copia y distribución de copias literales de este
   documento, pero no se permite su modificación.

</para>

<sect2><title>Preámbulo</title>
<para>

   Las licencias que cubren la mayor parte del software están diseñadas
   para quitarle a usted la libertad de compartirlo y modificarlo. Por el
   contrario, la Licencia Pública General de GNU pretende garantizarle la
   libertad de compartir y modificar software libre, para asegurar que el
   software es libre para todos sus usuarios. Esta Licencia Pública
   General se aplica a la mayor parte del software del la Free Software
   Foundation y a cualquier otro programa si sus autores se comprometen a
   utilizarla. (Existe otro software de la Free Software Foundation que
   está cubierto por la Licencia Pública General de GNU para
   Bibliotecas). Si quiere, también puede aplicarla a sus propios
   programas.
</para><para>

   Cuando hablamos de software libre, estamos refiriéndonos a libertad,
   no a precio. Nuestras Licencias Públicas Generales están diseñadas
   para asegurarnos de que tenga la libertad de distribuir copias de
   software libre (y cobrar por ese servicio si quiere), de que reciba el
   código fuente o que pueda conseguirlo si lo quiere, de que pueda
   modificar el software o usar fragmentos de él en nuevos programas
   libres, y de que sepa que puede hacer todas estas cosas.
</para><para>

   Para proteger sus derechos necesitamos algunas restricciones que
   prohiban a cualquiera negarle a usted estos derechos o pedirle que
   renuncie a ellos. Estas restricciones se traducen en ciertas
   obligaciones que le afectan si distribuye copias del software, o si lo
   modifica.
</para><para>

   Por ejemplo, si distribuye copias de uno de estos programas, sea
   gratuitamente, o a cambio de una contraprestación, debe dar a los
   receptores todos los derechos que tiene. Debe asegurarse de que ellos
   también reciben, o pueden conseguir, el código fuente. Y debe
   mostrarles estas condiciones de forma que conozcan sus derechos.
</para><para>

   Protegemos sus derechos con la combinación de dos medidas:
    1. Ponemos el software bajo copyright y
    2. le ofrecemos esta licencia, que le da permiso legal para copiar,
       distribuir y/o modificar el software.
</para><para>

   También, para la protección de cada autor y la nuestra propia,
   queremos asegurarnos de que todo el mundo comprende que no se
   proporciona ninguna garantía para este software libre. Si el software
   se modifica por cualquiera y éste a su vez lo distribuye, queremos que
   sus receptores sepan que lo que tienen no es el original, de forma que
   cualquier problema introducido por otros no afecte a la reputación de
   los autores originales.
</para><para>

   Por último, cualquier programa libre está constantemente amenazado por
   patentes sobre el software. Queremos evitar el peligro de que los
   redistribuidores de un programa libre obtengan patentes por su cuenta,
   convirtiendo de facto el programa en propietario. Para evitar esto,
   hemos dejado claro que cualquier patente debe ser pedida para el uso
   libre de cualquiera, o no ser pedida.
</para><para>

   Los términos exactos y las condiciones para la copia, distribución y
   modificación se exponen a continuación.

<para>

Términos y condiciones para la copia, distribución y modificación
</para>

<itemizedlist><listitem><para>
 Esta Licencia se aplica a cualquier programa u otro tipo de
       trabajo que contenga una nota colocada por el tenedor del
       copyright diciendo que puede ser distribuido bajo los términos de
       esta Licencia Pública General. En adelante, «Programa» se referirá
       a cualquier programa o trabajo que cumpla esa condición y «trabajo
       basado en el Programa» se referirá bien al Programa o a cualquier
       trabajo derivado de él según la ley de copyright. Esto es, un
       trabajo que contenga el programa o una proción de él, bien en
       forma literal o con modificaciones y/o traducido en otro lenguaje.
       Por lo tanto, la traducción está incluida sin limitaciones en el
       término «modificación». Cada concesionario (licenciatario) será
       denominado «usted».

</para><para>
       Cualquier otra actividad que no sea la copia, distribución o
       modificación no está cubierta por esta Licencia, está fuera de su
       ámbito. El acto de ejecutar el Programa no está restringido, y los
       resultados del Programa están cubiertos únicamente si sus
       contenidos constituyen un trabajo basado en el Programa,
       independientemente de haberlo producido mediante la ejecución del
       programa. El que esto se cumpla, depende de lo que haga el
       programa.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Usted puede copiar y distribuir copias literales del código fuente
       del Programa, según lo has recibido, en cualquier medio, supuesto
       que de forma adecuada y bien visible publique en cada copia un
       anuncio de copyright adecuado y un repudio de garantía, mantenga
       intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran a esta Licencia y a la
       ausencia de garantía, y proporcione a cualquier otro receptor del
       programa una copia de esta Licencia junto con el Programa.
</para><para>
       Puede cobrar un precio por el acto físico de transferir una copia,
       y puede, según su libre albedrío, ofrecer garantía a cambio de
       unos honorarios.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
       Puede modificar su copia o copias del Programa o de cualquier
       porción de él, formando de esta manera un trabajo basado en el
       Programa, y copiar y distribuir esa modificación o trabajo bajo
       los términos del apartado 1, antedicho, supuesto que además cumpla
       las siguientes condiciones:
</para><para>
         a. Debe hacer que los ficheros modificados lleven anuncios
            prominentes indicando que los ha cambiado y la fecha de
            cualquier cambio.
</para><para>
         b. Debe hacer que cualquier trabajo que distribuya o publique y
            que en todo o en parte contenga o sea derivado del Programa o
            de cualquier parte de él sea licenciada como un todo, sin
            carga alguna, a todas las terceras partes y bajo los términos
            de esta Licencia.
</para><para>
         c. Si el programa modificado lee normalmente órdenes
            interactivamente cuando es ejecutado, debe hacer que, cuando
            comience su ejecución para ese uso interactivo de la forma
            más habitual, muestre o escriba un mensaje que incluya un
            anuncio de copyright y un anuncio de que no se ofrece ninguna
            garantía (o por el contrario que sí se ofrece garantía) y que
            los usuarios pueden redistribuir el programa bajo estas
            condiciones, e indicando al usuario cómo ver una copia de
            esta licencia. (Excepción: si el propio programa es
            interactivo pero normalmente no muestra ese anuncio, no se
            requiere que su trabajo basado en el Programa muestre ningún
            anuncio).
</para><para>

       Estos requisitos se aplican al trabajo modificado como un todo. Si
       partes identificables de ese trabajo no son derivadas del
       Programa, y pueden, razonablemente, ser consideradas trabajos
       independientes y separados por ellos mismos, entonces esta
       Licencia y sus términos no se aplican a esas partes cuando sean
       distribuidas como trabajos separados. Pero cuando distribuya esas
       mismas secciones como partes de un todo que es un trabajo basado
       en el Programa, la distribución del todo debe ser según los
       términos de esta licencia, cuyos permisos para otros
       licenciatarios se extienden al todo completo, y por lo tanto a
       todas y cada una de sus partes, con independencia de quién la
       escribió.
</para><para>
       Por lo tanto, no es la intención de este apartado reclamar
       derechos o desafiar sus derechos sobre trabajos escritos
       totalmente por usted mismo. El intento es ejercer el derecho a
       controlar la distribución de trabajos derivados o colectivos
       basados en el Programa.
</para><para>
       Además, el simple hecho de reunir un trabajo no basado en el
       Programa con el Programa (o con un trabajo basado en el Programa)
       en un volumen de almacenamiento o en un medio de distribución no
       hace que dicho trabajo entre dentro del ámbito cubierto por esta
       Licencia.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
       Puede copiar y distribuir el Programa (o un trabajo basado en él,
       según se especifica en el apartado 2, como código objeto o en
       formato ejecutable según los términos de los apartados 1 y 2,
       supuesto que además cumpla una de las siguientes condiciones:
</para><para>
         a. Acompañarlo con el código fuente completo correspondiente, en
            formato electrónico, que debe ser distribuido según se
            especifica en los apartados 1 y 2 de esta Licencia en un
            medio habitualmente utilizado para el intercambio de
            programas, o
</para><para>
         b. Acompañarlo con una oferta por escrito, válida durante al
            menos tres años, de proporcionar a cualquier tercera parte
            una copia completa en formato electrónico del código fuente
            correspondiente, a un coste no mayor que el de realizar
            físicamente la distribución del fuente, que será distribuido
            bajo las condiciones descritas en los apartados 1 y 2
            anteriores, en un medio habitualmente utilizado para el
            intercambio de programas, o
</para><para>
         c. Acompañarlo con la información que recibiste ofreciendo
            distribuir el código fuente correspondiente. (Esta opción se
            permite sólo para distribución no comercial y sólo si usted
            recibió el programa como código objeto o en formato
            ejecutable con tal oferta, de acuerdo con el apartado b
            anterior).

       Por código fuente de un trabajo se entiende la forma preferida del
       trabajo cuando se le hacen modificaciones. Para un trabajo
       ejecutable, se entiende por código fuente completo todo el código
       fuente para todos los módulos que contiene, más cualquier fichero
       asociado de definición de interfaces, más los guiones utilizados
       para controlar la compilación e instalación del ejecutable. Como
       excepción especial el código fuente distribuido no necesita
       incluir nada que sea distribuido normalmente (bien como fuente,
       bien en forma binaria) con los componentes principales
       (compilador, kernel y similares) del sistema operativo en el cual
       funciona el ejecutable, a no ser que el propio componente acompañe
       al ejecutable.
</para><para>
       Si la distribución del ejecutable o del código objeto se hace
       mediante la oferta acceso para copiarlo de un cierto lugar,
       entonces se considera la oferta de acceso para copiar el código
       fuente del mismo lugar como distribución del código fuente,
       incluso aunque terceras partes no estén forzadas a copiar el
       fuente junto con el código objeto.

       No puede copiar, modificar, sublicenciar o distribuir el Programa
       excepto como prevé expresamente esta Licencia. Cualquier intento
       de copiar, modificar sublicenciar o distribuir el Programa de otra
       forma es inválida, y hará que cesen automáticamente los derechos
       que te proporciona esta Licencia. En cualquier caso, las partes
       que hayan recibido copias o derechos de usted bajo esta Licencia

       No está obligado a aceptar esta licencia, ya que no la ha firmado.
       Sin embargo, no hay hada más que le proporcione permiso para
       modificar o distribuir el Programa o sus trabajos derivados. Estas
       acciones están prohibidas por la ley si no acepta esta Licencia.
       Por lo tanto, si modifica o distribuye el Programa (o cualquier
       trabajo basado en el Programa), está indicando que acepta esta
       Licencia para poder hacerlo, y todos sus términos y condiciones
       para copiar, distribuir o modificar el Programa o trabajos basados

       Cada vez que redistribuya el Programa (o cualquier trabajo basado
       en el Programa), el receptor recibe automáticamente una licencia
       del licenciatario original para copiar, distribuir o modificar el
       Programa, de forma sujeta a estos términos y condiciones. No puede
       imponer al receptor ninguna restricción más sobre el ejercicio de
       los derechos aquí garantizados. No es usted responsable de hacer

       Si como consecuencia de una resolución judicial o de una alegación
       de infracción de patente o por cualquier otra razón (no limitada a
       asuntos relacionados con patentes) se le imponen condiciones (ya
       sea por mandato judicial, por acuerdo o por cualquier otra causa)
       que contradigan las condiciones de esta Licencia, ello no le exime
       de cumplir las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si no puede realizar
       distribuciones de forma que se satisfagan simultáneamente sus
       obligaciones bajo esta licencia y cualquier otra obligación
       pertinente entonces, como consecuencia, no puede distribuir el
       Programa de ninguna forma. Por ejemplo, si una patente no permite
       la redistribución libre de derechos de autor del Programa por
       parte de todos aquellos que reciban copias directa o
       indirectamente a través de usted, entonces la única forma en que
       podría satisfacer tanto esa condición como esta Licencia sería
       evitar completamente la distribución del Programa.

       legislación aplicable. Excepto cuando se indique de otra forma por
       escrito, los tenedores del copyright y/u otras partes proporcionan

       garantías mercantiles implícitas o a la conveniencia para un
       propósito particular. Cualquier riesgo referente a la calidad y

<sect2><title>Cómo aplicar estos términos a sus nuevos programas</title>
<para>

   Si usted desarrolla un nuevo Programa, y quiere que sea del mayor uso
   posible para el público en general, la mejor forma de conseguirlo es
   convirtiéndolo en software libre que cualquiera pueda redistribuir y
   cambiar bajo estos términos.
</para><para>

   Para hacerlo, añada los siguientes anuncios al programa. Lo más seguro
   es añadirlos al principio de cada fichero fuente para transmitir lo
   más efectivamente posible la ausencia de garantía. Además cada fichero
   debería tener al menos la línea de «copyright» y un indicador a dónde
   puede encontrarse el anuncio completo.
</para><para>
   «una línea para indicar el nombre del programa y una rápida idea de
   qué hace.»
</para><para>

   Copyright (C) 19aa «nombre del autor»
</para><para>

   Este programa es software libre. Puede redistribuirlo y/o modificarlo
   bajo los términos de la Licencia Pública General de GNU según es
   publicada por la Free Software Foundation, bien de la versión 2 de
   dicha Licencia o bien (según su elección) de cualquier versión
   posterior.
</para><para>

   Este programa se distribuye con la esperanza de que sea útil, pero SIN
   NINGUNA GARANTÍA, incluso sin la garantía MERCANTIL implícita o sin
   garantizar la CONVENIENCIA PARA UN PROPÓSITO PARTICULAR. Véase la
   Licencia Pública General de GNU para más detalles.
</para><para>

   Debería haber recibido una copia de la Licencia Pública General junto
   con este programa. Si no ha sido así, escriba a la Free Software
   Foundation, Inc., en 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307
   EEUU.
</para><para>
   Añada también información sobre cómo contactar con usted mediante
   correo electrónico y postal.

   Si el programa es interactivo, haga que muestre un pequeño anuncio
   como el siguiente, cuando comienza a funcionar en modo interactivo:
</para><para>
   Gnomovision versión 69, Copyright (C) 19aa nombre del autor

   Gnomovision no ofrece ABSOLUTAMENTE NINGUNA GARANTÍA. Para más

   Esto es software libre, y vd. es libre de redistribuirlo bajo ciertas
   condiciones. Para más detalles escriba «show c».
</para><para>
   Los comandos hipotéticos «show w» y «show c» deberían mostrar las
   partes adecuadas de la Licencia Pública General. Por supuesto, los
   comandos que use pueden llamarse de cualquier otra manera. Podrían
   incluso ser pulsaciones del ratón o elementos de un menú (lo que sea
   apropiado para su programa).
</para><para>
   También deberías conseguir que su empleador (si trabaja como
   programador) o tu Universidad (si es el caso) firme un «renuncia de
   copyright» para el programa, si es necesario. A continuación se ofrece
   un ejemplo, altere los nombres según sea conveniente:

       Yoyodyne, Inc. mediante este documento renuncia a cualquier interés de
       derechos de copyright con respecto al programa Gnomovision (que

   Esta Licencia Pública General no permite que incluya sus programas en
   programas propietarios. Si su programa es una biblioteca de
   subrutinas, puede considerar más útil el permitir el enlazado de
   aplicaciones propietarias con la biblioteca. Si este es el caso, use
   la Licencia Pública General de GNU para Bibliotecas en lugar de esta
   Licencia.
