The easiest route for most people will be to use a 
<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/">set of Debian CDs</ulink>. 
If you have a CD set, and if your machine supports booting directly off
the CD, great!  Simply 
<phrase arch="i386">
configure your system for booting off a CD as described in 
<xref linkend="boot-dev-select"/>,
</phrase> 
insert your CD, reboot, and proceed to the next chapter.

Note that certain CD drives may require special drivers, and thus be
inaccessible in the early installation stages. If it turns out the
standard way of booting off a CD doesn't work for your hardware,
revisit this chapter and read about alternate kernels and installation
methods which may work for you.

Even if you cannot boot from CD-ROM, you can probably install the
Debian system components and any packages you want from CD-ROM.
Simply boot using a different media, such as floppies.  When it's
time to install the operating system, base system, and any additional
packages, point the installation system at the CD-ROM drive.
