 <title>Memory and Disk Space Requirements</title>

You must have at least &minimum-memory; of memory and &minimum-fs-size; of hard disk
space. For a minimal console-based system (all standard packages),
250MB is required. If you want to install a reasonable amount of
software, including the X Window System, and some development programs
and libraries, you'll need at least 400MB. For a more or less complete
desktop system, you'll need a few gigabytes.

On the Amiga the size of FastRAM is relevant towards the total memory
requirements.  Also, using Zorro cards with 16-bit RAM is not
supported; you'll need 32-bit RAM.  The <command>amiboot</command>
program can be used to disable 16-bit RAM; see the 
<ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;">Linux/m68k FAQ</ulink>.  Recent kernels should
disable 16-bit RAM automatically.

On the Atari, both ST-RAM and Fast RAM (TT-RAM) are used by Linux.
Many users have reported problems running the kernel itself in Fast
RAM, so the Atari bootstrap will place the kernel in ST-RAM. The
minimum requirement for ST-RAM is 2 MB. You will need an additional
12 MB or more of TT-RAM.

On the Macintosh, care should be taken on machines with RAM-based
video (RBV). The RAM segment at physical address 0 is used as screen
memory, making the default load position for the kernel unavailable.
The alternate RAM segment used for kernel and RAMdisk must be at least
4 MB.
