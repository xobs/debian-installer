It is <emphasis>essential</emphasis> that, when booting MacOS in
preparation for booting the Penguin linux loader, you must hold the
<keycap>shift</keycap> key down to prevent extensions from
loading. (If you don't use MacOS except for loading linux, you can
accomplish the same thing by removing all extensions and control
panels from the Mac's System Folder. Otherwise extensions may be left
running and cause random problems with the running linux kernel.
