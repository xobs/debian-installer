<para>

If you elect to make the hard disk boot directly to GNU/Linux, <phrase
condition="supports-nfsroot">and you are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
installing a diskless workstation,</phrase> you will be asked to
install a master boot record. You will want to do this unless you are
using a boot manager or you have another operating system on the same
machine.  You won't be able to boot into MS-DOS normally on your
machine, for instance.  Be careful, and see 
<xref linkend="reactivating-win"/>.

If you install a master boot record, the next question will be whether
you want to boot GNU/Linux automatically from the hard disk when you
turn on your system. This sets GNU/Linux root partition to be the
<emphasis>bootable partition</emphasis> &mdash; the one that will be
loaded from the hard disk.

The standard &architecture; boot loader is called <quote>LILO</quote>.
It is a complex program which offers lots of functionality, including
MS-DOS, NT, and OS/2 boot management.  Please carefully read the
instructions in the directory
<filename>/usr/share/doc/lilo/</filename> if you have special needs;
also see the <ulink url="&url-lilo-howto;">LILO mini-HOWTO</ulink>.

If you can no longer boot into MS-DOS, you'll need to use a MS-DOS
boot disk and use the <userinput>fdisk /mbr</userinput> command to
reinstall the MS-DOS master boot record &mdash; however, this means
that you'll need to use some other way to get back into Debian! For
more information on this please read
<xref linkend="reactivating-win"/>.
