<title>&debian; Installation Guide</title>

<abstract>
<para>
This document contains installation instructions for the &debian;
&release; system, for the &arch-title; (<quote>&architecture;</quote>)
architecture.  It also contains pointers to more information and
information on how to make the most of your new Debian system.
</para>

<warning condition="not-checked"><para>
This installation guide is based on an earlier manual written for
the old Debian installation system (the "boot-floppies"), and has
been updated to document the new Debian installer. However, for
&architecture;, the manual has not been fully updated and fact checked
for the new installer. There may remain parts of the manual that are
incomplete or outdated or that still document the boot-floppies
installer. A newer version of this manual, possibly better documenting
this architecture, may be found on the Internet at the
<ulink url="&url-d-i;">&d-i; home page</ulink>. You may also be able
to find additional translations there.
</para></warning>

<note condition="checked"><para>
Although this installation guide for &architecture; is mostly up-to-date,
we plan to make some changes and reorganize parts of the manual after the
official release of &releasename;. A newer version of this manual may be
found on the Internet at the <ulink url="&url-d-i;">&d-i; home page</ulink>.
You may also be able to find additional translations there.
