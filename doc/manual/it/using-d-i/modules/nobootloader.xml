   <title>Continue Without Boot Loader</title>

<para>

This option can be used to complete the installation even when no boot
loader is to be installed, either because the arch/subarch doesn't
provide one, or because none is desired (e.g. you will use existing
boot loader). <phrase arch="m68k">This option is especially useful for
Macintosh, Atari, and Amiga systems, where the original operating system
must be maintained on the box and used to boot GNU/Linux.</phrase>
