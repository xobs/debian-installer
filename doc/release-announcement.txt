Debian-Installer release candidate 1

The Debian-Installer team announces the first release candidate of the
Debian sarge installer. Significant improvements in this release of the
installer include:

 - Support for the s390 architecture, completing the full set of 11 
   released Debian architectures.
 
 - Added support for more subarches for arm (riscpc, riscstation),
   m68k (bvme6000, mvme147, mvme16x), mipsel (cobalt) and powerpc
   (oldworld).
 
 - Native port to the amd64 architecture. Note that amd64 packages are not
   yet available in the Debian archive; packages and images are available
   from the Debian amd64 project. <http://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/>
   
 - CD images finally work for sparc64.
 
 - Full size CD images are available as part of the release for the first
   time. Note that this is not an official release of Debian sarge, just a
   Debian-Installer beta release.
   
 - Supports installing using the 2.6 kernel on powerpc.
 
 - Installing with the 2.6 kernel on i386 is no longer considered
   experimental as it was in previous betas, but is still not the default.
   
 - Support for firewire CD drives and firewire ethernet.
 
 - Added and improved support for a wide variety of other hardware.

 - Improved documentation.

 - Numerous bug fixes and improvements -- far too many to list here.

 - Translated into 40 languages (36 fully complete), including new 
   translations to Croatian and Farsi.
 
 - The latest and greatest versions of everything from Debian's testing
   distribution, which is close to official release itself.

We're confident that this is our best release ever, so give it a try,
install Debian today, and don't forget to file an installation report so we
can continue to make the installer even better.
