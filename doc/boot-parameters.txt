This is a list of all the boot parameters for the installer. These
environment variables are typically set on the boot loader command line.
For example:
  boot: linux DEBCONF_PRIORITY=low BOOT_DEBUG=1

DEBCONF_PRIORITY

	Control how many questions the installer asks. Default is high, use
	medium or low for more control, critical to make as few decisions
	as possible.

DEBCONF_FRONTEND

	Pick the frontend to use. Default is newt. Other frontends are not
	available on default install media, so this is not very useful.

DEBCONF_DEBUG

	Control how much debugging output goes in the log. 5 for a lot, 0
	for none.

BOOT_DEBUG

	Use this if the installer is not booting up properly, to get a more
	verbose boot process. It's set to a number:
		0 = not much, the default
		1 = more verbose
		2 = lots of debugging information
		3 = shells are run at various points in the boot
		    exit the shell to continue the boot
	Not supported by all boot methods currently.

bootkbd
	
	Specify the keyboard maping to use. For example, bootkbd=us

INSTALL_MEDIA_DEV

	The value of the parameter is the path to the device to load the
	Debian installer from. For example:
		INSTALL_MEDIA_DEV=/dev/floppy/0
	
	The boot floppy, which normally scans all floppys and USB storage
	devices it can to find the root floppy, can be overridden by this
	parameter to only look at the one device.

In addition to the above, any debconf variable in debian-installer can have
its default value overridden on the command line. For example:

  boot: linux debconf/priority=low

There is not a complete list of all available debconf variables, and some
variables cannot be overridden at boot time. Here are some particularly
useful ones that are known to work:

debian-installer/framebuffer

	Set to "false" if enabling the frame buffer console causes problems.

debian-installer/probe/usb

	Set to "false" to prevent probing for USB on boot, if that causes
	problems.

netcfg/use_dhcp

	Set to "false" to prevent configuring the network with DHCP and to
	enter the information manually, if DHCP causes problems.

hw-detect/start_pcmcia

	Set to "false" to prevent starting PCMCIA services, if
	that causes problems.
